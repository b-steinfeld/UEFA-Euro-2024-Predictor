# 2024-Euros-Predictor
Goal: Trying to predict the 2024 Euros using webscrapping and machine learning.

After webscrapping, the initial algorithm is created to use test and train data on past matches in the last five years (did not include friendles). The algorithm has a precision of about 70%; just enough to be classifed as a useful model.

Then, a future predictor was created; in which, the train data would be each part of the tournament (round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final). As these are future matches, each of these csvs were manually created based on the outcome predicted.
